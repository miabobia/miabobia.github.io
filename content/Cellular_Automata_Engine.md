# Intro
You've probably heard of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) ![[https://miabobia.github.io/conways_example.gif]]

Conway's Game of Life is actually just one of Cellular Automata that exist! Cellular Automata can have many different rulesets (rules on conditions for cell's to come alive, survive or die)

What I made is an engine that can support **any** ruleset for Cellular Automata. It also is setup modularly so the Automata can be rendered in many different ways
